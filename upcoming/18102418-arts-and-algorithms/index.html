<p>This is the third meeting of “Arts and Algorithms”, a cross-disciplinary reading group of graduate students at Columbia. Artists and corporations have used artificial interlocutors in their live performances, installations, and advertising campaigns, raising interesting questions about agency and artistic identity in an age of algorithms. Conversational agents also lie at the heart of a growing number of communication systems: customer support lines, chatbots, and voice recognition interfaces. Readings in this meeting will explore what artists have learned from the creation of algorithmic collaborators and what designers of conversational agents can learn from the study of art. The reading group is supported by funding from the Center for Science and Society at Columbia University, under the Seed Grants for Interdisciplinary Research program.</p>
