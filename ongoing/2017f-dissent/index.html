<p>Our engagement with technology entails political, not just instrumental choices. Email clients, social networks, and word processors have a profound effect on the way we relate to each other: work, organize, relax, or make art. Yet, we rarely have a chance to reflect on the civic, cultural virtues implicit in numerous everyday acts of computation: connecting to a wi-fi access point, sending a text message, or sharing a photograph online.</p>

<p>Every week, the Technologies of Dissent Lab meets to turn the ideas discussed in the reading section of <a href="https://github.com/denten-courses/technologies-of-dissent/tree/master/2017-fall">ENG 4911</a> into practice.</p>
