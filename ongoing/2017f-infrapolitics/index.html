<p>This course lab focuses on infrastructure as a structuring principle of cities, highlighting the ways that urban spaces are physically shaped and ordered by a range of governing interventions—from natural resource extraction to urban planning, and the economics of real estate. The lab focuses on exploring cities in the Global South whose historical emergence points to a range of social conflicts manifest in urban policy and design, that challenges the adequacy (and efficacy) of dominant paradigms of infrastructural development derived from the history of American and European cities.</p>

<p>For this work we will use three cities as our case studies. The cities have been chosen because they offer important ways to think about how infrastructure organizes social life, and its ongoing political effects. By exploring different histories of how space is governed, segregated, or utilized as a key economic resource, we want students to think about the significance of space and spatial regulation in structuring social relations.</p>

<p>The case studies are organized around a set of keywords: informality (Mumbai), apartheid (Johannesburg), and populism (Medellin)—that are entry points for thinking about the infrastructure of inequality. Each of the case studies uses a critical event as a point of entry for asking how land, capital, government, and the social relations of daily life structure, and are in turn structured by spatial order.</p>

<p>Visualizing and mapping thus form key techniques for linking urban history with contemporary urbanism, and for thinking about the materiality of spatial politics</p>

<p>Note: This is the third in a series of multidisciplinary Mellon seminars on the topic of Conflict Urbanism.</p>
