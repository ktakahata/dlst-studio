<p>This course lab provides an introduction to mapping theory and geographic information systems tools. Through the use of open-source GIS software (<a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/">qGIS</a>) and open data (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>) students will learn how to critically use mapping tools and geographic data for spatial analysis and representation. In this course, students will work through a series of web tutorials and hands-on in-class exercises to gain a better understanding of how these tools and data can be leveraged to analyze, represent and study past or present urban phenomena. In addition to using existing data, students will also be able to create or bring their own sets of data and questions from other courses and will be able to work with these in our class.</p>
